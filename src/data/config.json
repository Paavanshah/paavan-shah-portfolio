  "about": [
    "My passion lies at the intersection of hardware and software—the art of giving machines the ability to sense, think, and interact with the world. As an Electronics and Communication Engineering student, I've channeled this curiosity into building intelligent systems from the ground up, driven by a fascination for robotics and autonomous navigation.",
    "This drive has led me to create tangible projects, from designing an 8-wheeled autonomous rover that won national-level competitions to developing a fully functional CubeSat prototype. My time as an intern at the Space Applications Center (ISRO) solidified this passion, allowing me to contribute to the cutting-edge sensor technology that powers space exploration.",
    "I believe the future is autonomous, and I am dedicated to being a part of the innovation that drives it. I am constantly learning and am eager to collaborate on projects that bring intelligent, real-world robotic systems to life."
